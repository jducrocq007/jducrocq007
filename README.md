 
# Hi, I'm Julienüëã
- üëÄ I am a **young researcher** specialized in image processing, AR/VR/XR and robotics. 
- üíûÔ∏è I am passionate about **art**, **video games**, **architecture** and **tourism**, and I am willing to contribute on these fields!
- üå± In addition, I am also very sensitive to the **environment** and I would really like to help preventing to destroy our planet.
- üíª I am proficient in **Unity**, **C#**, **Python**, **C++**, **Matlab**, **LaTeX** and **Blender**.
- üåê I can speak **French** and **English** fluently. I know a bit of Spanish and the bases of Japanese.

You can download my resume as a pdf file in [French](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mhEul8Cox0CuNg4z3ax7nLBqOYx0IdXG/view?usp=drive_link) and [English](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pjoTGhYf3q4KiQJhjROKkYh-AiNaV_Sj/view?usp=sharing).

### Job experience
- My very first experience (2016) is a two months research internship where I have measured the latency of a Ricoh Theta S camera.

- In 2018, I have done a 5 months internship where I have designed a Robotic Augmented Reality (**RAR**) interface which displays the slices of a virtual volume in real time.
  The first version of this interface, where an industrial robot is holding the slice screen, is presented on this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrgdhrxUiss) and the second version, where a carboard is attached to an HTC Vive controller, is shown [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r_69DwIFHs).

- During my ph. D (2019-2022), I have designed two cameras: 
  - **HDROmni**, a camera made of 4 mirrors and 3 ND filters able to capture HDR panoramic images of outdoors locations, which allows robot navigation.
     You can watch [here](https://youtu.be/uFzibmnuKWQ) the video that I have presented to IEEE ICRA 2021.
  - **Visadapt**, consisting on a camera facing a deformable mirror able to zoom in the key areas of a scene without discarding the rest.
     You can watch the prototype in action [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5D_jMuRIBVc).

My full ph. D thesis is available [on Hal](https://u-picardie.hal.science/tel-04095060/). 

More recently (2023-2025), I have designed a new interface to zoom-in locally within an image without losing the context, both on a screen and within a VR environment.
You can see a video presenting my IEEE VR 2025 demo [here](https://youtu.be/mMMdJj67vb4).
